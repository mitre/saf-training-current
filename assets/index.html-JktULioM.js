We need that code to record test results in a standardized format so that we can easily export our security data somewhere people can use it to make decisions (like the Heimdall visualization app, which we will discuss later).</p>',9),u={href:"https://saf.mitre.org",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},p=e("figure",null,[e("img",{src:a,alt:"The SAF Lifecycle",tabindex:"0",loading:"lazy"}),e("figcaption",null,"The SAF Lifecycle")],-1),m=e("p",null,"We hope that during this class you will become comfortable with the tools, parts and processes involved in the end-to-end process, and gain the confidence to start automating your compliance journey with the information presented here.",-1),f=e("p",null,"Let's get started!",-1);function y(g,v){const i=n("ExternalLinkIcon");return s(),r("div",null,[h,e("p",null,[t("This challenge is what the "),e("a",u,[t("MITRE Security Automation Framework"),l(i)]),t(" or MITRE SAF was developed to simplify -- to make the journey from a Requirement Document to an automated test profile and back again a little easier to navigate.")]),p,m,f])}const S=o(d,[["render",y],["__file","index.html.vue"]]);export{S as default};
