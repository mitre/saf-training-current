To determine if any hardware components for Bluetooth are loaded in the system, run the following command:

In some cases, determining when an item is NOT a finding might be appropriate.

When using a command to inspect the status of a host, listing example output can be helpful. The output must comply with STIG requirements unless an example of a failure is needed and is clearly explained.
