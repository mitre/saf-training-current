The choice depends on your team&#39;s preference for review speed and context switching.</li><li><strong>Major Version or Large Jump Release Updates:</strong> These updates require a thorough review of every single control and requirement. They also necessitate extensive testing, both automated (via the CI/CD testing matrix) and manual. In this scenario, the overhead of managing multiple micro or mini PRs can be substantial. However, the benefit is that it allows for more granitary control and review of changes. It&#39;s also easier to isolate and fix issues that arise during testing.</li></ul><p>In conclusion, the choice between micro and massive PRs depends on the specific needs and circumstances of your project.
