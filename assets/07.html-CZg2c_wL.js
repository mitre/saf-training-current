What are inputs and why do I need them?</h2><p>Every InSpec profile on the SAF site is written to comply with some security guidance. However, every team&#39;s environment may be just a little bit different. For example, the path to a file may be different in different environments, or the list of permitted users for a certain system may vary with the environment.</p><p>To accomodate for these kinds of differences, InSpec profiles utilize inputs. In the previous section, we ran the InSpec profile on the NGINX component without specifying any inputs. This means that it just used the defaults. Now, let&#39;s review these variables and decide which inputs we want to change for our environment.</p><div class="hint-container tip"><p class="hint-container-title">Best Practice</p><p>It is best practice to always run profiles with inputs so that the profile is properly tailored to your environment.</p></div><h2 id="_7-1-profile-inputs-see-inspec-yml-file" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_7-1-profile-inputs-see-inspec-yml-file" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 7.1 Profile Inputs (see <code>inspec.yml</code> file)</h2><p>This profile uses InSpec Inputs to make the tests more flexible.

We are going to make 2 changes to our InSpec command that we ran before. 
1. We are going to add \`--input-file inputs.yml\` to specify the inputs to the profile
2. We are going to change the name of our results file to \`./results/nginx_vanilla_results_with_inputs.json\` so it easy for us to distinguish the results later on.

This makes our new command:

\`\`\`sh
inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/nginx-stigready-baseline -t docker://nginx --input-file inputs.yml --reporter cli json:./results/nginx_vanilla_results_with_inputs.json
\`\`\`

### 7.3.1 CLI Results

You will see this result in the cli:

\`\`\`sh
inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/nginx-stigready-baseline -t docker://nginx --input-file inputs.yml --reporter cli json:./results/nginx_vanilla_results_with_inputs.json
