We need that code to record test results in a standardized format so that we can easily export our security data somewhere people can use it to make decisions (like the Heimdall visualization app).</p>',10),h={href:"https://saf.mitre.org",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},m=e("figure",null,[e("img",{src:i,alt:"SAF Lifecycle",tabindex:"0",loading:"lazy"}),e("figcaption",null,"SAF Lifecycle")],-1);function p(f,y){const a=s("ExternalLinkIcon");return r(),n("div",null,[u,e("p",null,[t("This challenge is what the "),e("a",h,[t("MITRE Security Automation Framework"),l(a)]),t(" or MITRE SAF was developed to simplify -- to make the journey from a Requirement Document to an automated test profile and back again a little easier to navigate.")]),m])}const w=o(d,[["render",p],["__file","index.html.vue"]]);export{w as default};
